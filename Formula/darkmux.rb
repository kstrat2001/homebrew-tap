# This is the source-of-truth Homebrew formula for darkmux. When the custom tap
# repo (kstrat2001/homebrew-tap per #618) is created, this file is copied
# into the tap as Formula/darkmux.rb. Editing it here keeps the formula
# version-controlled alongside the source it formulates.
#
# Operator-facing install path:
#   brew tap kstrat2001/tap
#   brew install darkmux                # stable release (v5.1.0)
#   brew install --HEAD darkmux         # build from main instead
#
# For local development / smoke testing:
#   brew install --build-from-source ./packaging/homebrew/darkmux.rb
#
# Tracking: #618 (this formula), #178 (skill it pairs with), #176 (sibling
# skill), #280 (related fleet primitive that simplifies post-formula).

  # Redis is OPTIONAL — operator decides single-machine vs hub:
  #   brew install darkmux                         # CLI only (single-machine)
  #   brew install darkmux && brew install redis   # hub posture
  # Documented in caveats below, not as a hard depends_on. A formula that
  # always pulls redis would force every CLI user to install a daemon they
  # don't run.

  def install
    # (#1129) Stamp a stable (tarball) build as a release so `darkmux --version`,
    # `darkmux doctor`, and the viewer header read `<version> (release)`. The
    # tarball has no `.git`, so without this stamp the build would be
    # indistinguishable from a bare source build. A `--HEAD` build has a git
    # checkout and bakes its short SHA instead, so leave it unstamped.

  def caveats
    <<~EOS
      darkmux is installed but the `serve` daemon is NOT started by default.

      Scope: this formula ships the `darkmux` CLI + `serve` daemon + the
      keychain wrapper + bundled skills. The `darkmux-runtime` Docker image
      that `darkmux dispatch` and `darkmux lab run` use is not bundled,
      but you don't build it by hand: on the first dispatch with no local
      image, darkmux pulls the version-pinned image from GHCR on demand
      (ghcr.io/kstrat2001/darkmux-runtime:<version>, #759) — you just need
      Docker running. (`docker build -t darkmux-runtime:latest runtime/` from
      a source checkout is the offline/dev alternative.) So brew is a complete
      install end to end: `dispatch` / `mission` / `machine` / `profile` /
      `flow` / `serve` / `doctor`, the hub coordinator role, AND local
      dispatches.

      For a single-machine CLI install (no daemon needed):
        # Already done. Run `darkmux --help` to explore.

      For a hub machine (Redis-backed, multi-machine fleet coordinator):
        1. brew install redis
           brew services start redis

        2. Set Redis password and store in Keychain. The wrapper script reads
           it at process-start (never lands in any file on disk).
             security add-generic-password -a "$USER" -s darkmux-redis -w
             # paste the password when prompted

           Then add `requirepass` to Redis matching that password:
             DARKMUX_REDIS_PASS=$(security find-generic-password \\
                                  -a "$USER" -s darkmux-redis -w)
             echo "requirepass \\"$DARKMUX_REDIS_PASS\\"" | \\
                  sudo tee -a #{HOMEBREW_PREFIX}/etc/redis.conf > /dev/null
             brew services restart redis

        3. In your shell rc (~/.zshrc), set per-machine identity:
             export DARKMUX_MACHINE_ID=studio     # operator-named; not hostname

           (The wrapper script picks up DARKMUX_MACHINE_ID from your env at
           launchd-load time. Re-run `brew services restart darkmux` after
           any change.)

        4. brew services start darkmux

      For the production-grade hub posture — Redis AOF persistence, audit
      substrate (BLAKE3 hash-chained JSONL; `darkmux flow integrity-check`
      recomputes each chain and reports the first divergence — see SECURITY.md
      for what it does and does not catch), log rotation, and daily integrity
      checks — see the guide:

        https://darkmux.com/guide/always-on-hub.html

      The Phase 2 launchd-plist section there is the under-the-hood version
      of what `brew services start darkmux` does for you; the other phases
      (Redis hardening, audit, log rotation, integrity check) remain
      operator-driven steps that compose on top of the brew-managed service.
